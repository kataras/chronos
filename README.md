Chronos provides an easy way to limit X operations per Y time in accuracy of nanoseconds.
Chronos is a crucial tool when calling external, remote or even internal APIs with rate limits.

### ðŸš€ Installation

The only requirement is the [Go Programming Language](https://golang.org/dl/).

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/kataras/chronos
```

> `chronos` has zero third-party dependencies rathen than the Go's standard library.

`Chronos` is very simple to use tool, you just declare the maximum operations(max) and in every Y time
that those operations are allowed to be executed(per). `Chronos` has the accuracy of nanoseconds.

You can use `chronos#Acquire` anywhere you want, but be careful because it waits/blocks for
availability to be executed.

```go
import (
    "time"

    "github.com/kataras/chronos"
)

func main() {
    // Allow maximum of 5 MyActions calls
    // per 3 seconds.
    c := chronos.New(5, 3 * time.Second)

    // The below actions will execute immediately.
    MyAction(c)
    MyAction(c)
    MyAction(c)
    MyAction(c)
    MyAction(c)
    // The below action will execute after 3 seconds from the last call
    // or when 3 seconds passed without any c.Acquire call.
    MyAction(c)
}

func MyAction(c *chronos.C) {
    <- c.Acquire()
    // Do something here...
}
```

The `<- c.Acquire()` is blocking when needed, no any further actions neeeded by the end-developer.
